SPAARO supports fixed-wing, multi-rotor, helicopter, and V/STOL vehicles. Software can be developed in Simulink or C++. A Simulink simulation is available for developing and validating algorithms prior to flight. Flight data is converted to MATLAB format for analysis, which can be opened by [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/index), and [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/). [MAVLink](https://mavlink.io/) is fully supported for real-time telemetry, in-flight-tunable parameters, flight plans, fences, and rally points. All Bolder Flight control systems are designed and assembled in the United States.

# Flight Control Systems

## FMU-R
The Research Flight Management Unit (FMU-R) is designed to provide unsurpassed data quality, determinism, and flexibility. FMU-R is ideally suited for early-stage R&D and features a plethora of ports for integrating new peripherals. FMU-R has the option of using a low-cost integrated IMU or adding a VectorNav VN-100, VN-200, or VN-300 IMU/INS. FMU-R can be used stand-alone or a BeagleBone Black or BeagleBone AI can be added for additional compute power; high bandwidth serial and USB connections are available for sharing data between the FMU-R and BeagleBone. FMU-R is designed around a consumer temperature range of 0C to +50C.

An integrated static pressure sensor is available or an external air data sensor can be added to collect differential and static pressure data from a pitot-tube. Multiple pressure ranges are available and sensors can be chained to accommodate 5 or 7 hole probes. Breakout boards are available to convert the JST-GH PWM or SBUS connectors to standard servo headers and have screw terminals for supplying servo rail power. VectorNav, SBUS, and PWM breakout boards can be mounted to the FMU-R for a compact, integrated solution.

### FMU-R v1.x

<img src="https://github.com/bolderflight/spaaro/blob/main/docs/img/fmu-r-v1.png" alt="FMU-R v1" width="400">

FMU-R v1.x consists of:
   * Cortex M4F processor, 180 MHz CPU frequency and a single precision hardware floating point unit.
   * Integrated voltage regulation with a +6.5V to +36V input range. Clean +5V output up to 2A is available for powering the FMU-R, BeagleBone, and peripherals.
   * Integrated 9 axis IMU and static pressure sensor.
   * SBUS input for integrating pilot commands.
   * 16 channels of SBUS output and 8 channels of PWM output.
   * Two I2C buses, two UARTs, and one SPI bus for connecting external sensors, such as air data, GNSS receivers, telemetry, and additional IMUs.
   * Two GPIOs for analog input, digital I/O, or additional PWM channels.
   * Integrated measurement of input voltage, regulated voltage, and servo rail voltages (up to +9.9V).
   * Two UARTs from the BeagleBone are brought out to convenient connectors for interfacing with external sensors.

The FMU-R v1.x schematic is [available here](./docs/fmu_r_v1_schematic.pdf).

### GNSS Receiver
[uBlox](https://www.u-blox.com/) 8 and 9 series GNSS receivers are supported via the UBX communication protocol. Bolder Flight Systems manufactures a small, low-cost GNSS receiver using the [SAM-M8Q module](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/sam-m8q-module). If better position accuracy is required, we recommend the [ZED-F9P dual frequency module](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/zed-f9p-module). [ArduSimple](https://www.ardusimple.com/product/simplertk2blite/) manufactures a small ZED-F9P receiver, which we use frequently with the FMU-R.

### Air Data Sensor
Bolder Flight Systems developed an air data sensor, which uses AMS5915 pressure transducers to measure static and differential pressure. Several pressure ranges are available and can be customized to the vehicle's airspeed range. Additionally, customized sensors can be built to support multi-hole probes for angle of attack and angle of sideslip measurement.

### VectorNav IMU/INS
VectorNav [VN-100](https://www.vectornav.com/products/vn-100), [VN-200](https://www.vectornav.com/products/vn-200), and [VN-300](https://www.vectornav.com/products/vn-300) IMU and INS sensors can be added to the FMU-R. These sensors are temperature calibrated and feature integrated navigation filter algorithms. The VN-200 and VN-300 include integrated GNSS receivers. The VN-300 includes dual GNSS receivers, which can be used to estimate the vehicle heading more accurately than magnetometer based approaches.

<!-- <img src="https://github.com/bolderflight/spaaro/blob/main/docs/img/vectornav.png" alt="VectorNav IMU/INS" width="250"> -->

### PWM and SBUS Breakouts
Boards are available to breakout the JST-GH connectors to standard servo connectors. 8 channels are available on each board and the SBUS boards can be daisy-chained for 16 total output channels. Servo power is bused and can be provided by a connected ESC, BEC, or via screw terminals. Servo rail voltage is measured up to +9.9V.

# Hardware Integration

### FMU-R v1.x
The FMU-R v1.x should be mounted near the vehicle c.g. with the SD card slot accessible, for retrieving flight data, and the micro USB accessible for updating flight software. Orientation of the IMU is shown below - a rotation matrix can be defined in the vehicle configuration to rotate the IMU to the vehicle body frame. 

<!-- An example installation in one of Bolder Flight's research fixed-wing UAS is also included.

INSERT IMAGE -->

If the BeagleBone is used, ensure accessibility to its mini USB or ethernet connector for uploading software. 2-56 standoffs and screws are supplied with the PWM, SBUS, and VectorNav breakout boards for mounting them to the FMU-R or to the vehicle. 4-40 standoffs and screws are supplied for mounting the FMU-R to the BeagleBone and / or the vehicle.

### GNSS Receiver
The SAM-M8Q includes an integrated patch antenna and should be mounted on top of the vehicle or under materials that would pass through GNSS frequencies (i.e. underneath monokote). The ZED-F9P uses an external antenna, the receiver can be mounted where convenient and the antenna would have the same restrictions as the SAM-M8Q.

2-56 standoffs and screws are supplied with the SAM-M8Q for mounting the GNSS receiver to the vehicle.

<!-- Examples of GNSS receiver installation for fixed-wing and multi-rotor vehicles are shown below.

INSERT IMAGE -->

Prior to installing the GNSS receiver, it must be configured in the uBlox u-center application. The following packets must be enabled on the receiver:
   * UBX-NAV-PVT
   * UBX-NAV-DOP
   * UBX-NAV-EOE

Optionally, if it's available, the following packet should be enabled for higher precision navigation:
   * UBX-NAV-HPPOSLLH

You should also use u-center to configure the navigation solution and transmission rate, the baud rate for the serial interface, expected operation environment (i.e. stationary, airborne, etc), and any corrections (RTK or CORS network). We recommend a solution rate of 5 Hz, the highest baud rate available (typically 921600) and an airborne operation environment.

### Air Data Sensor
If the air data sensor is used, we recommend mounting it near where the pitot-tub attaches to the aircraft to minimize pneumatic lag from long pressure lines. Silicon tubing with an inner diameter of 2mm and an outer diameter of 6mm is recommended; however, this is difficult to find in the United States. Tygon tubing with an inner diameter of 1/16" is relatively easy to find and works well for short tubing runs and connecting to the AMS5915 sensor. Longer runs, such as cases where the air data sensor cannot be mounted near the pitot-tube, should step the tubing up to a larger diameter to reduce losses. McMaster-Carr is a good source for pressure tubing, T and elbow connectors, and step-up connectors.

2-56 standoffs and screws are supplied with the air data sensor for mounting it to the vehicle.

<!-- An example of an air data sensor installation is shown below along with an image depicting the pressure ports.

## Electrical connections
JST-GH cables are supplied with each of the components.
   * The GNSS receiver and telemetry modules should be connected to the FMU-UART ports.
   * The air data sensor should be connected to one of the I2C ports.
   * The PWM and SBUS breakouts should be connected to the PWM and SBUS-TX ports, respectively.
   * An SBUS receiver should be connected to the SBUS-RX port.
   * If a VectorNav IMU/INS is used, it should be connected to the SPI port.
   * Power should be connected to the FMU-R PWR screw terminal. Typically this would be wired in parallel with the main aircraft battery so voltage could be monitored in flight. Supported voltage range is +6.5V to +36V.
   * Servo power should be supplied by either an ESC, BEC, or via the screw terminal on the PWM or SBUS breakout boards. Ensure that servo voltage does not exceed +9.9V.

# Setting up the Development Environment
Follow the [build tools guide](https://github.com/bolderflight/build-tools) for setting up your development environment. Additionally, if you plan on using the SPAARO Simulink simulation, you'll need:
   * MATLAB Simulink
   * Aerospace Blockset
   * Control System Toolbox (trimming and linearization)
   * Simulink Control Design (trimming and linearization)

If you plan on autocoding flight software, you will also need:
   * MATLAB Coder
   * Simulink Coder
   * Embedded Coder

# Configuring Aircraft
The aircraft sensors, real-time filtering and estimation, and effectors are configured with a configuration file, */flight_code/flight/config.cc*. Within that file, you'll find a bool *DEBUG* and a struct *config*. 

The software will output messages over the FMU-R micro USB. If *DEBUG* is set to *true*, the software will wait for a serial monitor to be opened before it starts booting, ensuring that you will receive all messages, which is useful for debugging any issues. If *DEBUG* is set to false, the software will immediately start booting on power-up, which is the typical configuration for flight.

The *config* struct has top-level items for *sensor*, *nav*, *effector*, and *telem*, which will be described in detail in the following sections.

## Sensors
*.sensor* configures the aircraft sensors.

### Pitot-Static Installed
The first configurable item is whether an air data sensor is installed and should be used for static and differential pressure sensing. This is simply a boolean *true* (air data sensor installed), *false* (air data sensor not installed).

```C++
/* Pitot static sensor not installed */
.sensor = {
  .pitot_static_installed = false,
}
```

### Inceptor
The *.inceptor* struct configures the inceptor data from a pilot, i.e. converting the data from an SBUS receiver to meaningful information.

First, the serial port used to receive SBUS data is specified. This is defined in */flight_code/include/flight/hardware_defs.h* based on the FMU version and should not be changed from the default value.

Next, the inceptor channels are configured. The 7 channels are:
   * *throttle_en*: provides for a switch on the pilot remote to safe the motors (false) or enable them (true). Useful for ground testing and providing an extra level of safety during flight operations.
   * *mode0*: a mode switch, which can be used to select different flight modes in software. Typically, this is mapped to a 3 position switch on the pilot remote and configured to output an integer 0, 1, or 2 depending on switch position.
   * *mode1*: a mode switch, which can be used to select different flight modes in software. Typically, this is mapped to a 3 position switch on the pilot remote and configured to output an integer 0, 1, or 2 depending on switch position.
   * *throttle*: non-dimensional mapping of the pilot throttle stick. Typically, this is mapped to a float 0 - 1 value to provide a throttle percentage command from the pilot.
   * *pitch*: non-dimensional mapping of the pilot pitch stick. Typically, this is mapped to a float -1 to +1 value with a positive value resulting in a positive rate or angle movement on the vehicle.
   * *roll*: non-dimensional mapping of the pilot roll stick. Typically, this is mapped to a float -1 to +1 value with a positive value resulting in a positive rate or angle movement on the vehicle.
   * *yaw*: non-dimensional mapping of the pilot yaw stick. Typically, this is mapped to a float -1 to +1 value with a positive value resulting in a positive rate or angle movement on the vehicle.

Each channel is configured with an SBUS channel number and a polynomial mapping the SBUS data to the desired output value. A typical SBUS range is 172 - 1811 for FrSky receivers using 100% range. If extended range limits are used, the range is typically 0 - 2047.

An example configuration is below. The *throttle_en* is mapped to -1 (false) to +1 (true). Mode switches are mapped to output 0, 1, or 2. *throttle* is mapped 0 to 1, and pitch / roll / yaw sticks are mapped -1 to +1. All of the polynomials are linear (i.e. 2 coefficients).

```C++
.inceptor = {
  .hw = &SBUS_UART,
  .throttle_en = {
    .ch = 6,
    .num_coef = 2,
    .poly_coef = {0.0012202562538133f, -1.20988407565589f}
  },
  .mode0 = {
    .ch = 4,
    .num_coef = 2,
    .poly_coef = {-0.0012202562538133f, 2.3f}
  },
  .mode1 = {
    .ch = 5,
    .num_coef = 2,
    .poly_coef = {-0.0012202562538133f, 2.3f}
  },
  .throttle = {
    .ch = 0,
    .num_coef = 2,
    .poly_coef = {0.00061013f, -0.10494204f}
  },
  .pitch = {
    .ch = 2,
    .num_coef = 2,
    .poly_coef = {0.0012203f, -1.2098841f}
  },
  .roll = {
    .ch = 1,
    .num_coef = 2,
    .poly_coef = {0.0012203f, -1.2098841f}
  },
  .yaw = {
    .ch = 3,
    .num_coef = 2,
    .poly_coef = {0.0012203f, -1.2098841f}
  }
},
```

### IMU
The *.imu* struct configures the integrated IMU. First, the communication bus information and frame rate is specified, which are defined in */flight_code/include/flight/hardware_defs.h* and should not be modified.

Next, the accelerometer bias, magnetometer bias, accelerometer scale factor, and magnetometer scale factor can be configured. These are defined such that:

```
y = c * x + b
```

Where *y* is the corrected sensor output, *c* is the scale factor matrix, *x* is the uncorrected sensor output, and *b* is the bias vector. An ideal sensor would have a bias vector of zeros and an identity scale factor matrix.

We typically estimate accelerometer bias and scale factor by collecting data on the FMU-R with each axis aligned with gravity in a positive and negative sense. We then fit the bias and scale factor such that we get a magnitude in each axis of 9.80665.

The magnetometer is typically calibrated in vehicle with the electronics powered and the motors off since we usually only use the magnetometer to initialize the aircraft heading for the navigation filters. The aircraft is rotated in a sphere for all three axes and in post-processing we estimate the bias and scale factors necessary to fit the magnetometer data to a sphere.

A rotation matrix can be defined to rotate the IMU into the vehicle frame. The rotation matrix is defined such that:

```
y = c * x
```

Where *x* is the sensor data, *c* is the rotation matrix, and *y* is the sensor data rotated into the vehicle frame.

An example IMU configuration is:

```C++
.imu = {
  .dev = IMU_CS,
  .frame_rate = FRAME_RATE_HZ,
  .bus = &IMU_SPI_BUS,
  .accel_bias_mps2 = {0, 0, 0},
  .mag_bias_ut = {0, 0, 0},
  .accel_scale = {{1, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1}},
  .mag_scale = {{1, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1}},
  .rotation = {{0, 1, 0}, {-1, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 1}}
},
```

### GNSS
The *.gnss* struct configures the GNSS receiver. The configurable items are the sampling period, in ms, the baud rate, and the serial bus the receiver is connected to. Below is an example configuration of a receiver connected to FMU-UART3, with a baud rate of 921600, and an update rate of 5 Hz.

```C++
.gnss = {
  .sampling_period_ms = 200,  // 5 Hz
  .baud = 921600,
  .bus = &Serial3
},
```

### Static Pressure
The *.static_pres* struct configures the static pressure sensor. If an air data sensor is not used, all of the items are defined in */flight_code/include/flight/hardware_defs.h* and should not be modified.

```C++
.static_pres = {
  .dev = PRES_CS,
  .sampling_period_ms = FRAME_PERIOD_MS,
  .bus = &PRES_SPI_BUS
},
```

If an air data sensor is used, configurable items include the I2C bus, I2C address, and transducer type. Typically the AMS1200B is used as a static pressure sensor.

```C++
.static_pres = {
  .dev = 0x10,
  .transducer = bfs::AMS5915_1200_B,
  .sampling_period_ms = FRAME_PERIOD_MS,
  .bus = &WIRE1
},
```

### Differential Pressure
The *.diff_pres* struct configures the differential pressure sensor. Configurable items include the I2C bus, I2C address, and transducer type. Typically the AMS1200B is used as a static pressure sensor.

```C++
.diff_pres = {
  .dev = 0x11,
  .transducer = bfs::AMS5915_0010_D,
  .sampling_period_ms = FRAME_PERIOD_MS,
  .bus = &WIRE1
},
```

## Navigation Filter
The *.nav* struct configures the navigation filter. 

Data flow from the sensor is:
1. Anti-alias filtering is applied, if available, based on the FMU sample rate.
2. Bias and scale factor corrections are applied. For the accelerometer and magnetometer, these are defined in the sensor configuration. For the gyro and differential pressure sensor, biases are estimated on startup.
3. The IMU is rotated into the vehicle frame.

This process yields the sensor data that is output. In the navigation filter:
1. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) uses IMU and GNSS data to estimate vehicle position, velocity, attitude, and accelerometer and gyro biases.
2. Accelerometer and gyro biases are removed.
3. Digital low pass filters are applied to the IMU and pressure transducer data.
4. This data is used to estimate derived quantities, such as pressure altitude, airspeed, NED position, etc.

Configurable items include the accelerometer, gyro, mag, static pressure, and differential pressure digital low pass filter cutoff frequencies. An example *nav* configuration is:

```C++
.nav = {
  .accel_cutoff_hz = 20,
  .gyro_cutoff_hz = 20,
  .mag_cutoff_hz = 10,
  .static_pres_cutoff_hz = 10,
  .diff_pres_cutoff_hz = 10
},
```

## Effectors
The *.effector* struct configures the vehicle's effectors (motors and actuators). This configuration is split into SBUS and PWM effectors, depending on the communication protocol used. For the SBUS configuration, the SBUS-TX serial port is defined in */flight_code/include/flight/hardware_defs.h* and should not be modified. For the PWM configuration, the set of pin numbers defining the PWM output is defined in */flight_code/include/flight/hardware_defs.h* and should not be modified.

The configurable item for each effector is:
   * *type*: bfs::SERVO or bfs::MOTOR depending on whether it is a servo or motor.
   * *ch*: the channel the effector is connected to.
   * *min*: the minimum input value.
   * *max*: the maximum input value.
   * *failsafe*: the command that should be issued when the servo or motor is safed.
   * *num_coef* and *poly_coef*: a polynomial taking input value, typically an angle command, to output value, typically 1000 - 2000 ms for a PWM effector or 172 - 1811 for an SBUS effector.

Typically output commands from the control laws, which are inputs to the effectors, are in angle commands. The *min*, *max*, and *failsafe* are all defined in terms of these values.

An example SBUS configuration for a servo is:

```C++
.sbus = {
  .hw = &SBUS_UART,
  .effectors = {
    {
      /* Elevator */
      .type = bfs::SERVO,
      .ch = 2,
      .min = bfs::deg2rad(-20.0f),
      .max = bfs::deg2rad(20.0f),
      .failsafe = 0,
      .num_coef = 4,
      .poly_coef = {1144.32190165984f, 167.225360182927f,
                    1558.74885501875f, 1026.6382652891f}
    },
  }
}
```

An example PWM configuration for a motor is:

```C++
.pwm = {
  .hw = PWM_PINS,
  .effectors = {
    {
      /* ESC */
      .type = bfs::MOTOR,
      .ch = 0,
      .min = 0,
      .max = 1,
      .failsafe = 0,
      .num_coef = 2,
      .poly_coef = {1000.0f, 1000.0f}
    }
  }
}
```

Servos are commanded to their failsafe values if the inceptors receive a failsafe mode from the SBUS receiver, meaning the receiver has lost link with the transmitter for many frames in a row. The failsafe positions for servos could be designed such that the flight is terminated (i.e. a descending spiral).

Motors are commanded to their failsafe values if the inceptors receiver a failsafe mode from the SBUS receiver or if the inceptor *throttle_en* value is false. Typically a motor failsafe would be set to the minimum throttle command.

## Telemetry
The *.telem* struct configures the telemetry radio modem. The configurable items are the aircraft type, serial bus, and the baud rate.

The aircraft type can be:

| Aircraft Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| bfs::FIXED_WING | Fixed-wing aircraft |
| bfs::HELICOPTER | Helicopter |
| bfs::MULTIROTOR | Multirotor |
| bfs::VTOL | VTOL aircraft |

An example configuration for a fixed-wing aircraft with the telemetry radio modem connected to FMU-UART4, and a baud rate of 57600 is below.

```C++
.telem = {
  .aircraft_type = bfs::FIXED_WING,
  .bus = &Serial4,
  .baud = 57600
}
```
