# Flight Software
Welcome to Bolder Flight System's flight software! It pulls together common sensing, filtering, estimation, actuation, datalogging, and telemetry modules, providing input and output around the vehicle management system and control laws. Vehicle management logic and control laws can be implemented directly in C/C++ or developed in our [Simulink simulation](https://github.com/bolderflight/simulation) and autocoded.
